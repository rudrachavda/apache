# poc-csv-render

Assumption:
- CSV has sample data in columns (customer name, balance, zip code, state) 
- I will be using those four parameters for proof of concept

Problem statement:
- React-based Web interface utilizing Apache echarts, which displays line, bar, or pie charts based on user selection.
- This chart displays data of balance, zip of state from CSV

Future Improvements:
- Make it more generic by allowing any CSV format to be uploaded and custom field selection for chart rendering
